# Firebase Deployment Fix Guide

## Problem
After deploying fixes to Firebase, the hosted site still shows old code with errors.

## Root Causes
1. **Old build files** - Firebase is deploying outdated build folder
2. **Browser cache** - Your browser cached the old version
3. **Firebase CDN cache** - Firebase's CDN is serving cached files
4. **Service Worker cache** - React's service worker cached old version

---

## ‚úÖ Complete Fix Steps

### Step 1: Clean Old Build Files
```bash
# Navigate to edumentor directory
cd edumentor

# Remove old build folder (Windows PowerShell)
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force build

# OR if using Command Prompt
rmdir /s /q build
```

### Step 2: Create Fresh Production Build
```bash
# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Create new production build with latest fixes
npm run build
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Wait for build to complete successfully. Look for:
```
The build folder is ready to be deployed.
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Firebase
```bash
# Deploy to Firebase
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### Step 4: Clear Firebase Hosting Cache
```bash
# Force cache clear by deploying with cache control headers
firebase deploy --only hosting -force
```

### Step 5: Clear Browser Cache
After deployment:-
1. **Hard Refresh:** Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (or `Cmd + Shift + R` on Mac)
2. **Or Clear Cache:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Right-click on refresh button
   - Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
3. **Or Clear Site Data:**
   - F12 ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Clear site data

## üöÄ Complete Deployment Script

Run these commands in order:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd edumentor

# 2. Clean old build
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force build

# 3. Create fresh build
npm run build

# 4. Deploy to Firebase (with force flag)
firebase deploy --only hosting --force

# 5. Clear CDN cache (optional but recommended)
firebase hosting:disable
firebase hosting:enable
```

## üîç Verification Steps

### 1. Check Build Folder
After `npm run build`, verify the build folder has your latest code:
```bash
# Check when build folder was created (should be recent)
Get-ChildItem build | Select-Object LastWriteTime
```

### 2. Check Deployed Files
After deployment, visit your site and:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Check the timestamp of loaded files
4. Look for your recent changes in the source code

### 3. Test the Fixes
1. Go to profile page
2. Open console (F12)
3. Verify:
   - ‚úÖ No "Profile fetch timeout" error
   - ‚úÖ No repeated refresh token errors
   - ‚úÖ Profile data displays correctly
   - ‚úÖ Display name check works properly

## üõ†Ô∏è If Changes Still Don't Reflect

### Option 1: Invalidate All Cache
```bash
# Disable and re-enable hosting (clears CDN cache)
firebase hosting:disable
firebase hosting:enable

# Re-deploy
firebase deploy --only hosting --force
```

### Option 2: Use Incognito/Private Window
1. Open new incognito/private window
2. Visit your hosted site
3. Check if changes appear
4. If yes ‚Üí it's a browser cache issue
5. If no ‚Üí redeploy with fresh build

### Option 3: Check Firebase Console
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project
3. Go to Hosting
4. Check "Release history"
5. Verify latest deployment timestamp
6. Check deployed files

### Option 4: Add Cache Busting Headers
Create/update `firebase.json`:
```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "build",
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ],
    "headers": [
      {
        "source": "**/*.@(js|css)",
        "headers": [
          {
            "key": "Cache-Control",
            "value": "public, max-age=0, must-revalidate"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "source": "**",
        "headers": [
          {
            "key": "Cache-Control",
            "value": "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Then redeploy:
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting --force
```

## üìù Best Practices for Future Deployments

### 1. Always Clean Build Before Deployment
```bash
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force build
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting --force
```

### 2. Check Build Success
Look for this message:
```
Compiled successfully.
The build folder is ready to be deployed.
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
After deployment, check:
- Firebase Console ‚Üí Hosting ‚Üí Release history
- Visit hosted URL in incognito mode
- Test all fixed features

### 4. Use Version Numbers
Add version number to your app to track deployments:
```javascript
// In App.js or package.json
console.log('App Version: 1.0.1');
```
