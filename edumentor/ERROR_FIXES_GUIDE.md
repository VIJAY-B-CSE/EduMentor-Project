# Error Fixes Guide

This document explains the errors you encountered and how they were fixed.

## Error 1: Invalid Refresh Token (400 Error)

### **What Happened:**
```
AuthApiError: Invalid Refresh Token: Refresh Token Not Found
```

### **Cause:**
The authentication session expired or the refresh token became invalid. This commonly happens when:
- The browser is idle for too long
- The session expires
- The token stored in localStorage is corrupted

### **Fix Applied:**
1. Added better error handling in `AuthContext.jsx` to detect refresh token errors
2. Gracefully clear authentication state when token refresh fails
3. Prevent the app from trying to refresh an invalid token repeatedly

### **What This Means:**
- If your token expires, you'll be logged out gracefully
- No more infinite retry loops
- Clear error messages instead of crashes

## Error 2: Display Name Check Error

### **What Happened:**
```
Display name check failed: Error: Display name is already taken. Please choose a different one.
```

### **Cause:**
The display name uniqueness check was throwing an error but the error handling wasn't properly stopping the save operation. The error was being caught but still logged, causing confusion.

### **Fix Applied:**
1. Changed error handling to use `setError()` and `return` instead of throwing
2. Now properly stops the save operation when display name is taken
3. Shows clear error message to the user
4. Continues save if the uniqueness check fails due to network issues

### **What This Means:**
- Clear feedback when display name is taken
- Save operation stops properly
- Better user experience with clear error messages

## How to Test the Fixes

### Step 1: Restart Development Server
```bash
npm start
```

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (hard refresh)
- Or clear browser cache and cookies

### Step 3: Test Profile Page
1. Go to your profile page
2. Try editing your profile
3. Check console for errors

### Step 4: Test Display Name Uniqueness
1. Click Edit on your profile
2. Try changing your display name to one that's already taken (e.g., "vj")
3. Click Save
4. You should see a clear error message: "Display name is already taken. Please choose a different one."
5. The save operation should stop without crashing

### Step 5: Monitor for Refresh Token Errors
1. Leave the app open for a while (10-15 minutes)
2. Check if the app handles token expiration gracefully
3. You should be logged out smoothly without errors

## If You Still See Errors

### Refresh Token Error Still Appears:
1. **Clear browser storage:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application > Storage
   - Click "Clear site data"
   - Refresh page

2. **Re-login:**
   - Logout completely
   - Close browser
   - Re-open and login again

### Display Name Error Persists:
1. **Check if the name is actually taken:**
   - Try a completely unique name
   - Use numbers or special characters

2. **Check Supabase database:**
   - Go to Supabase dashboard
   - Check `profiles` table
   - Look for duplicate `display_name` values

### Profile Data Not Showing:
1. **Run the test script** (in browser console):
   ```javascript
   // Copy from test-profile-fix.js
   ```

2. **Check database directly:**
   - Go to Supabase dashboard
   - SQL Editor
   - Run: `SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE id = '<your-user-id>';`
