# New User Profile Display Fix

## Problem
When new users sign up and visit their profile page, empty fields were showing single colored circles instead of "Not specified" text.

## Root Cause
The rendering logic was checking `if (Array.isArray(data))` which returns `true` even for empty arrays `[]`. When mapping over an empty array, it produces no visible content, resulting in just the colored circle background showing.

## Solution
Updated all array-based field rendering to check both:
1. `Array.isArray(data)` - Is it an array?
2. `data.length > 0` - Does it have items?

Now the logic is:
```javascript
if (Array.isArray(languages) && languages.length > 0) {
  // Render tags
} else {
  // Show "Not specified" text
}
```

## Fields Fixed

### Student Profile:
1. ✅ **Languages Known** - Now shows "Not specified" when empty
2. ✅ **Primary Career Interests** - Now shows "Not specified" when empty
3. ✅ **Top Skills** - Now shows "Not specified" when empty

### Mentor Profile:
1. ✅ **Industries** - Now shows "Not specified" when empty
2. ✅ **Specializations / Skills** - Now shows "Not specified" when empty
3. ✅ **Mentorship Focus Areas** - Now shows "Not specified" when empty
4. ✅ **Languages Spoken** - Now shows "Not specified" when empty

## Testing

### Test Case 1: New User Signup
1. Create a new student account
2. Complete signup without filling optional fields
3. Go to profile page
4. **Expected:** All empty fields show "Not specified" instead of colored circles

### Test Case 2: Existing User with Empty Fields
1. Login as existing user
2. Go to profile page
3. **Expected:** Fields with data show tags, empty fields show "Not specified"

### Test Case 3: Edit and Save
1. Login as any user
2. Click Edit on profile
3. Add data to empty fields
4. Save
5. **Expected:** Tags appear for filled fields, "Not specified" for empty ones

## Before vs After

### Before (Bug):
```
Languages Known
[empty space with just background color - looked like a circle]
```

### After (Fixed):
```
Languages Known
Not specified
```

## Files Modified
- `edumentor/src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx`
  - Updated rendering logic for all array-based fields
  - Added `&& array.length > 0` check to all field renderers

## Impact
- ✅ Improves user experience for new users
- ✅ Clear indication of which fields need to be filled
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Works for both student and mentor profiles
- ✅ Consistent display across all multi-value fields

## Next Steps
1. Test with a new user signup
2. Verify all empty fields show "Not specified"
3. Verify filled fields still show tags correctly
4. Deploy to production using deployment script
